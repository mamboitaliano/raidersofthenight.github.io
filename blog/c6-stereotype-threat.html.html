      Stereotype threat is a situation in which a person might feel at risk of confirming a specific stereotype about their social group, thus producing anxiety and, in turn, reducing their intellectual performance. This has shown to especially be the case when the person belongs to a negatively stereotyped group. When negative stereotypes are present, members of the negatively stereotyped group tend to become anxious about their performance, which actually in itself reduces their performance. The individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated, which seems to be obvious since most members of a negatively stereotyped group probably do not believe the stereotypes to be true themselves. Anxiety decreases performance by affecting the individual's working memory. Stereotype threat potentially contributes to racial and gender gaps in academic performance, and occurs whenever an individual's performance - which is already being affected by stereotype threat - might confirm a negative stereotype, thus creating a cyclical loop where performance degradation due to stereotype threat feeds on itself. In particular, tasks that aim to measure an individual's abilities, such as the SAT or any other type of aptitude test for that matter, can trigger or increase stereotype threat. Stereotype threat can also be triggered or increased when the task is one that the individual hopes to do well on, and when said individual strongly associates with the group that is negatively stereotyped.

      I personally cannot pinpoint any particular instance of my life where I have experienced stereotype threat. I have been called a "WOP" or a dago for being Italian, but all of these have come from friends or roommates who were simply joking around. Personally, I am not aware of any stereotypes about Italians being less intelligent than others. While stereotype threat is an interesting topic to explore, it isn't anything new to me. Since I was a toddler, I have had many friends that belong to other social or ethnic groups. Growing up in Geneva, Switzerland, my neighbor and best friend, Timothy, was the son of the ambassador from Madagascar. In college, two of my closest friends were African-American. George Mason University was ranked the most diverse university in the nation in 2004 by the Princeton Review, and during my time there, I was part of a fraternity that was approximately 40% white, with the rest consisting of African-Americans, Africans, Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Russians, and Jews. As I said ealier, I can't think of any particular time where I might have experienced stereotype threat, however, I have definitely seen friends of mine succumb to it. Luis, a friend of mine, was debating whether or not to finish his bachelor's degree, arguing that only a small percentage of college graduates are latino, therefore, why bother? He later realized that his logic was flawed, and he ended up graduating summa cum laude with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. One day, while preparing to give a presentation in class, one of my group members and a close friend said that he should let me present because "white people sound smarter". I called him out on that, stating that what he had just said was bullshit, and that I'm not going to present his part for him. So he went ahead and presented his part of the project, which was great since we later discovered that the professor was placing most of the grade's weight on the quality of the presentation and on how evenly it was distributed among all group members. Had he not presented, his grade would have suffered, making him a direct victim of stereotype threat.

      I cannot pretend to know what it's like to be a victim of stereotype threat. One thing I could try to do is to give positive reinforcement when I encounter a situation in which a friend or colleague is experiencing stereotype threat. However, I'm not going to do that either because that would be contradictory. I will not treat anyone, whether they're white, black, or half-black half-Mexican and gay, like they're different simply because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation. I'm not saying that I'm so high and mighty that I'm immune to racism. Everyone feels bias in one way or another, however minuscule it may be. Everyone sees color too. All I'm saying is that I've grown up with friends of almost all ethnic, social, and religious groups, and while I have heard some stereotypes about various groups, I've never actually believed them to be true. We all come from different parts of the world and have different backgrounds, preferences, and religions. What's important is that we realize that, while we may be different from one another, what lies under our skin is the same accross all humans that inhabit this tiny, pale blue dot in the vast and unknown void we call space. If, on such a tiny planet, we can't learn to get along, then humankind is doomed.
