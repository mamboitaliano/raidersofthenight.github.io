      It's been a long week. During this week, I attended the last few days of work before leaving my job (which entailed training two new employees, including the guy replacing me), wrapped up my final project for one of my grad school classes and took care of other end-of-semester assignments. I also saw my mom and my brother who flew in from Italy, got the cars fixed up, bought a bike, and did a whole bunch of other things in preparation for phase 1. In conclusion, I really haven't had much time to overhaul my entire github.io site. In fact, along with the reading, the four challenges to complete, along with two blog posts and all the preparation for phase-1, I don't see how most people would have had time to rework their entire website. Quite frankly, the time expectations for this week's curriculum is a bit unrealistic.
