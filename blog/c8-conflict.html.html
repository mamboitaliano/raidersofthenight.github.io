      I can't recall the last conflict I had. I'm not a very "conflicting" person. However, I can recall an argument between my wife and I some months ago that erupted into a shouting match that ultimately resulted in each of us storming off in our cars just to get away from each other. We live in an apartment big enough for the both of us but that's about it. Needless to say, there is a tendency for it to get cluttered up over time. I guess I'm what you could call a neat freak - I can't focus, concentrate, or think clearly in a messy and/or cluttered environment. So I do my best to keep the place clean in order to keep myself from going nuts. Yet for as long as I could remember it had always been a one-sided effort. She would get home, leave her shoes, clothes, books and makeup items everywhere, without considering the fact that I had told her many times how I felt about her sloppy habits and asked her to "work with me on this one". Each time I brought it up, her excuse was that she was so busy with her grad school classes and that it had been such a long day that she would deal with her messes later. One day, I arrived home from work and had to immediately get started on a paper for one of my grad school courses.The apartment was a monolithic mess. Binder paper on which she kept her notes was scattered all over the place, hair-care hardware like brushes and curling irons were left out on the living room table, and the usual clothes were scattered around the floor and couch. It looked like the place had been robbed. The dishes - not one of them used by me - had begun to pile up and smell, and the place hadn't been vacuumed in over a week.

      Prioritizing my tasks, I ignored the mess and proceeded to work on my paper. After turning it in, I was excited to have some free time. "Maybe I'll play some xbox for an hour or two", I thought to myself. Yet when I walked into the living room, there was the huge mess staring right at me. So I started cleaning, growing more and more bitter as minute after minute of my precious xbox time was being eaten away. Then, when my wife got home, I lost it. We shouted at each other loud enough for our neighbors to hear, and I stormed out, got in my car, and just drove away like a madman on speed with no particular destination in mind. As I began to cool my jets, it dawned on me that I had been disproportionately harsh on her, to the point where one might have thought we were arguing about something much, much more serious than a messy home. I recalled the basic, animal-like emotions of anger, frustration, and rage surging through my body like electric current. Realizing this, I asked myself whether any household mess is ever worth getting my heart rate so high, to the point of anger and rage. A more important question was whether any mess in the world ever warranted making a loved one cry.

      Thinking about the tears in her eyes, I spun the car around and headed home. My wife was laying on the bed, crying. In the hour during which I was gone, she had cleaned up the entire apartment from top to bottom, done all the dishes, and had vacuumed. She said she was scared and that she never wanted to see me like that again. I took her in my arms, held her tight, and apologized to her for blowing up like a nuke over something so petty. As her tears subsided, she admitted that she hadn't done her part, accepted that living together is a team effort, and promised to help me clean up the apartment whenever necessary. Since then, we have both upheld our part of the bargain. However, if I could go back and do things differently, I would have presented my concerns in a much calmer, procedural manner in which nobody needed to cry. Through this experience, I learned that people meet offense with defense, which can make getting your point across a lot harder than it needs to be.
