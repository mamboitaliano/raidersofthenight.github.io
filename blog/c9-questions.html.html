      I actually have never asked a question anywhere on the Internet. I've been meaning to create a StackOverflow account and start posting but I have always found that, with the right kind of question phrased in the right way, asking Google will usually yield the answer, or something close enough to allow me to figure it out on my own. This actually highlights the first characteristic: not having to ask the question in the first place is the best way to get the answer you're looking for. It's called doing your research/due dilligence/homework. Often times you'll find that researching the answer on your own actually leads you to the answer you're looking for in less time than it would take you to (1) log onto StackOverflow or Yahoo Answers or whatever you're using, (2) thinking about how to write the perfect question, (3) re-reading the question to make sure you asked it well, (4) posting the question, and then (5) waiting x-amount of time for someone to post a response that may or may not be the answer to your problem. I guess you could call this the DRY principle of question asking: don't repeat the same question others have already asked. Doing so will actually get your question taken down from sites like Stack Overflow. In addition, you might even learn more by doing the research on your own than relying on someone to provide you with the answer. It's called exercising your brain.

      Nevertheless, if you've already scoured the internet and come to the conclusion that you must in fact ask a question, then these are the characteristics you want your question to have:
      <ul>
        <li>Pretend like you're trying to answer the question and ask yourself - from an external point-of-view - whether you would take time out of your precious day to answer it or not</li>
        <li>Make the title clear and concice; it's what will determine whether people will be inclined to answer your question or move on</li>
        <li>Make sure the context of the question is clear. Provide people with essential info such as the language and platform you're using, etc. These you can usually list as tags</li>
        <li>Make sure the problem statement of the question is clear</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide an 'executive summary' at the beginning of your question</li>
            <li>Follow up with a more detailed description: what is the larger aim of what you're trying to accomplish? What's your end goal? Etc etc...</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Try to provide sample code if possible to give people an idea of what is going on</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing sample code allows people to cut-and-paste it into their IDE, compile the code and run it, which allows them to see firsthand what you're going through</li>
            <li>Make sure that you're not being thrown off by some dumb mistake like forgetting to #include <cmath> if you're using math functions in C++ or something similar</li>
            <li>Try not to bring up a UI</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the problem by giving your expectations versus what you actually ended up with</li>
            <li>Be as short as possible. People are taking time out of their lives to help you so don't make them spend more than they need to on it</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Make sure your spelling and grammar is clear and correct so you don't sound like a five year old</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      The most common characteristics in questions that did not get answered are usually the fact that said questions have already been asked and therefore have been flagged as so. Other common characteristics are the exact ones listed above: lack of clarity, lack of context, lack of problem description/background/etc. Follow the instructions above and you'll likely get the answer you're looking for.
