        If you're new to HTML and CSS, chances are you've driven youself crazy trying to position HTML elements in a manner that makes your page look stylish, clean, organized and easy to use. If you haven't, then I applaud you: you're a natural web designer! The rest of us, however, could use a brief tip on how to position HTML elements neatly on a web page using the static, absolute, relative, and fixed positioning types in CSS. So whadaya say? Let's get started? 
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        First, let's go over what it means for an element's position property to be <span class="bolded">static</span>. Static positioning basically means that your HTML elements would follow a "natural order", so to speak. For example, if you were to create an orange square and a blue square without setting any <span class="code">position</span> properties, it would default to <span class="code">position: static</span>, and you would see an blue square with an orange square stacked on top of it, like this: 
      </p>
        <div><img src="https://github.com/raidersofthenight/raidersofthenight.github.io/blob/master/blog/blog-imgs/stacked-divs-1.PNG?raw=true" alt="div example 1"/></div>
        <p class="bodytext">
          Notice that I specified each element's <span class="code">position</span> property to <span class="code">static</span>? Hence the natural stacked order of things. Unlike <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com">Warren Buffett</a>, we're more ambitious than that. So, let's go ahead and set each div's <span class="code">position</span> property to <span class="code">absolute</span>. 
        </p>
         <div><img src="https://github.com/raidersofthenight/raidersofthenight.github.io/blob/master/blog/blog-imgs/stacked-divs-2.PNG?raw=true" alt="div example 2"/></div>
        <p class="bodytext">
          What happened? Where did the blue square go? The answer is simple. Absolute positioning positions an element in relation to the first parent element it has that does not have the position property of <span class="code">static</span>. If there is no parent element, then it gets positioned relative to the <span class="code">html</span> element (relative to the entire html document). Since both of the squares are children of <span class="code">html</span>, they will both be positioned one behind the other in the upper left corner. 
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          Now, let's try something different. Let's set the <span class="code">position</span> properties of our squares to <span class="code">relative</span> and set the orange square's position from the lef to <span class="code">left:2em</span> and see what happens. 
        </p>
        <div><img src="https://github.com/raidersofthenight/raidersofthenight.github.io/blob/master/blog/blog-imgs/stacked-divs-3.PNG?raw=true" alt="div example 3"/></div>
        <p class="bodytext">
          See how the orange square shifted to the right by 2em? That's because relative positioning positions an element <span class="italicized">relative to its normal position</span>, i.e. where it would be if you didn't assign it any <span class="code">position</span> property. So, the combination of assigning to an element the <span class="code">position</span> of <span class="code">relative</span> and then specifying a <span class="code">2em</span> distance from the left would shift the element <span class="code">2em</span> from where it would normally be. Pretty straight-forward huh?
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          Now let's move on to try something really cool. Let's say that you want to have a sidebar with links to your other blog posts positioned on the left of the page, but you don't want it to move out of the screen when a user scrolls down. Instead, you want it to stay on the screen regardless of whether or not the user scrolls down the page. In this case, you would use <span class="code">fixed</span> positioning. When an item is assigned the <span class="code">position</span> property of <span class="code">fixed</span>, it is positioned relative to the browser window and will not move even if you scroll. 
        </p>

        <p class="bodytext">
          I hope this was helpful and that you now understand the difference between the different positioning properties in CSS. Ciao!
