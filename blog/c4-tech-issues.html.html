      A non-practicing entity (NPE), patent holding company (PHC), or a patent assertion entity (PAE), all of which are more commonly known as "patent trolls", are presneting the tech industry with a serious problem. As the name implies, patent trolls are companies holding companies that purchase patents for the sole purpose of unconvering and enforcing patent violations. Patent trolls seek to maximize revenue by purchasing or filing as many patents as possible in order to then pursue suspected violations through litigation and other leagal means and ultimately collecting the proceeds from any victorious legal dispute. The United States Patent Office often times issues patents for ideas that aren't necessarily "novel", and those patents are often very broad, sometimes covering things so commonplace that they shouldn't ever need to have been patented in the first place. They then threaten legal action against any alleged "infringer" unless they agree to pay a licensing fees that sometimes surpass a hudred thousand dollars. Since patent litigation is insantely expensive and time consuming, these alleged "infringing" companies will just choose to pay up. Patent trolls are in the business of litigation. They do not actually make anything. Instead, they use patents as legal weapons. <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/resources-patent-troll-victims">("Patent Trolls" - Electronic Frontier Foundation)</a>

      So what does this all mean in the big picture? Let's say you've got a Ph. D in electrical engineering from MIT and you buddy has a Masters in Computer Science form Stanford. One night at the bar, you both come up with an awesome idea: a smartphone that can walk to you using a series of built in legs when you're in one room and it's in the other. Genius, right? You just say "OK Google - come here right meow", and your smartphone literally gets up and walks to you. Did I mention it displays an image of Chuck Norris when it walks? You both have a terrible hangover the next day but you're smart and motivated and it's a game-changing idea, so you both get to work on building a prototype. Four months later, you've got a flawless working prototype! So you hire a lawyer and start the process of building your own company.

      By now, TechCrunch has already started blabbering about possible rumors of your awesome next-gen smartphone. It's a hit. It's disruptive. It's a game-changer. It can follow you while tweeting Chuck Norris jokes! It. Is. Awesome. Now everyone wants to buy you out. In fact, Apple makes you an offer for $100 billion, then Google says na-uuh and makes you an offer for #1 trillion! You'd me worth more than some countries' GDP. However, before you can finish filing your Articles of Incorporation, you get served with a nasty lawsuit. It turns out that Intellectual Ventures is sueing you on the grounds that they hold the "original" patent on the walking smartphone. Hell, they even hold patents for flying smartphones, rocket-powered smartphones, submarine smartphones, and even walking pagers...just in case. Now you're stuck in the middle of a serious legal battle which eventually kills your company and forces you to pay a lot of money. That's the job of a patent troll.

      "Patents were never intended to operate this way, so patent trolls sap rather than add commercial and customer value, and they impede innovation" says Eric Openshaw, Vice Chairman of Deloitte's US Tech, Media & Telecommunications Practice in <a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/2014-technology-outlook.html">Deloitte's 2014 Technology Outlook</a>. Openshaw further goes on to describe one of the outcomes being "a surge in companies buying pieces of patent portfolios, not necessarily because they want the underlying technology, but instead motivated by fear that pieces of someone else’s intellectual property (IP) might reside in their systems." According to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/resources-patent-troll-victims">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, "many factors contribute to the problems we’ve seen with the patent system, but perhaps none so much as the rise of the patent troll".
