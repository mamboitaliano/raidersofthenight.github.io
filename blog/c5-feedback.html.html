      So far, I've had 10 pairing sessions, and so far, they've all been great. All of my pairing partners were kind, respectful, and overall good people. However, kindness and respect go both ways. It is my policy to open each pairing session with a conversation about anything other than the task at hand. Why? Because you can't truly exhibit kindness and respect without having at least taken a few minutes of your time to get to know whom it is that you'll be working with. Communication is key, and dialog opens the doors to mutual respect and kindness. Therefore, if you're that person that's getting more negative than positive feedback, my advice to you is as follows: slow your role. Chill out and get to know your fellow boots. They're humans too, but they're gonna have trouble treating you like one if you can't do the same for them. Open each pairing session with a conversation. It doesn't need to be long - 5 minutes will do. If you've never met your pair before, ask them how they're doing, where they're from, how they're holding up through this especially demanding part of their lives. Be curious, but most importantly - be nice. Nobody takes kindly to an asshole, so don't be a dick (pardon mon Francais).

      Pairing is nothing new to me. Earlier in 2014, I began entertaining my curiosity for computer science and programming by taking both a C++ course and a Java course side-by-side at College of Marin, in Kentfield, California. My professor, <a href="http://www.marin.edu/apps/directory/EmployeeProfile.aspx?EmpID=3597">Mia Chia</a>, strongly emphasized the importance of working in teams when coding. A few weeks into the semester, I realized that the difference in my ability to think clearly and concisely when working with others versus working alone is like night and day. The reason for this can best be explained by personal example. My father is a career in-house corporate lawyer with a short fuse, and my Italian mother has a very narrow sense of patience. What does that mean for me? It means that I get the worst of both worlds: I generally have little patience and am easily suceptible to frustration. It means that I have killed many keyboards, computers, and other miscellaneous hardware out of sheer frustration in the past. While programming, I've often gotten stuck and felt that sense of frustration rising inside of me, like a cauldron of molten lava about to overflow. I have found that when this happens, it only worsens the problem. It's harder to think clearly and calmly, and in-turn, harder to solve problems. However, when working as a team - whether it's with one other person or with a group, everybody is in the same boat, and everyone knows it. As long as each team member clearly communicates their ideas, informs their team mates about the way they feel, and interacts with other team mates in a manner that promotes respect and support, then the sheer sense of knowing that each team member is in this together relieves a lot of the uncertainty and nervousness that arises when working alone. Consequently, this eases tension not only between team mates, but on the individual level as well, promoting a calm and relaxed collaborative environment. For people like me - short fused and short-tempered - a calm and relaxed environment is the only environment conducive to good programming.

       I felt great when I read my feedback in Socrates. Each piece of feedback was very kind and respectful, and my ratings are overall high. However, after reading and re-reading through each piece of feedback, I cannot yet say that it's helpful to my learning because there's not very much criticism to act on. I like people, I'm outgoing, and I'm friendly. I'll respect you if you take the time to know me a little and I won't be a dick because I think it's counter-productive and it's just not in my nature. I'd like to say that the reason for the lack of actionable criticism in my feedback is because I'm an awesome person to pair with, but I'm not going to say that because I know for a fact that I'm not perfect and that there are many things I know I could do better. Insofar as writing feedback goes, like I said before - every person I've paired with has been great. Sure, there are a couple of times where my pair and I were having difficulty solving the challenge at hand, but those difficulties were purely technical and none stemmed from any lack of kindness or respect. This actually makes it really hard to write feedback that is actionable, specific and kind because most of the time there is little or nothing to be specific about and therefore there is little or nothing to write that could be considered actionable.

     <p class="bodytext">
       Overall, I'm a strong advocate of pairing. When it comes to feedback, however, I don't think that it should be a requirement that feedback be actionable and specific. Rather, I think that the only concrete requirement is that feedback be kind. The actionable and specific part should be necessary if and only if there is constructive criticism to give. From my experience, people are great almost all the time. If I pair with someone for whom I have constructive criticism to give, then I will by all means be as actionable and specific as I can be.
