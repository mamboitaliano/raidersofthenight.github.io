      So far, the DBC experience seems pretty awesome. I particularly admire the fact that it's not centered around how tech-smart you are or whether or not you have a computer science degree but rather on whether or not you believe that you can conquer your fears and believe in yourself and what you'll become after having gone through the DBC journey. Personally I think that I fall into the group that exhibits fear of not knowing enough about programming and web development, but I also know that I can be a very fast and efficient learner when I'm motivated and determined. And motivated I am, so I can't wait to embark on this journey and give it my all.

        I see myself engaging with this culture quite well. In regards to Shereef's kitchen and table analogy, I believe that viewing this experience from the kitchen's "all in this together standpoint" is not only super important but is the only way to get through a program such as DBC, where we'll all be pushed to our limits and will learn more that we've ever learned in such little time. Also, going back to the EQ video, I believe I have a lot to gain from practicing emotional intelligence, not just at DBC but in life in general.

        My expectations of DBC haven't really changed. I believe that part of my expectations for DBC are also partly expectations I have for myself. From what I gather, DBC is a two way street that can't be travelled unless you're willing to do so and are prepared for what might lie ahead. Now, am I excited to participate in this learning environment? Absolutely. I took two computer science classes before joining DBC: Intro to Programming in Java and Intro to Programming in C++. Despite the fact that I had never really coded anything at all before that, I passed them with flying colors because I actually really enjoyed what I was doing (something I never felt in all of my undergrad classes studying poli sci). In particular, I felt this rush whenever I'd sit down behind Visual Studio because I was excited to know that I was learning to build something meaningful and absorbing the skills that would point me to a career that I would love. Does it make me nervous? Of course, but there's not much of a choice because I know this is what I need to do and by God I'm gonna do it and come out the person I've always wanted to be :) Now...LET'S DO THIS!
