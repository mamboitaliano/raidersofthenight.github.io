      The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) aims to mimic things (objects) in real world. Just like objects and things exist in the real world, OOP aims to structure a program in a manner in which objects and things exist as a core structural component of a program's source code. One of the best way to describe this is through the video game example. Let's go with the popular Battlefield franchise. For better or worse, war is very much a reality of the modern world. In every war, there are people involved, as well as weapons and vehicles like tanks, ships, and fighter jets, among many other things. To further break it down, let's think about all the types of people involved. There are definitely civilians involved. There are obvioulsy soldiers involved too, right? Let's keep breaking it down. Out of all the soldiers, there are different factions, such as U.S. soldiers and Russian soldiers. And in each faction, there are numerous types of soldiers, like infantry, medics, engineers, support, special forces, Navy SEALs, etc. In Battlefield 1942, each type of soldier gets different things by default. For example, if you're an American medic, your primary weapon is the Thompson submachine gun, your secondary weapon is M1911 .45 caliber handgun, your "gadget" is the Medical Bag, your melee weapon is a knife, you carry grenades, and your starting health is '30'.

      While I've never actually seen the source code for Battlefield 1942, I'm going to assume that it was written in an object-oriented language. In the case of the soldier, there would be a master class <span class="code">Person</span>. This class would be what is known as a "superclass", or "parent class", meaning that it has "subclasses" or "child classes" which would include the <span class="code">Soldier</span> and <span class="code">Civilian</span> classes. The <span class="code">Soldier</span> class would itself be the direct superclass of the <span class="code">USArmySoldier</span>, <span class="code">BritishArmySoldier</span>, <span class="code">FrenchArmySoldier</span>, or <span class="code">CanadianArmySoldier</span> classes. The <span class="code">Soldier</span> class would effectively act as the "blueprint" for a generic soldier of any faction in Battlefield 1942. It would contain the variables and methods common to each type of soldier. Think of it. In a first-person shooter video game, what would each type of <span class="code">Soldier</span> have in common regardless of whether they're <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span>, <span class="code">CanadianMedic</span>, or <span class="code">RedArmyInfantry</span>? Well, in the real world, a soldier in the battlefield does a number of things such as sprint, strafe left, strafe right, jump, take cover, crouch, fire, reload, or throw a grenade. Similarly, the <span class="code">Soldier</span> class would have methods for each of the aforementioned actions. It is important to understand that in OOP, the order of specialization flows down the branch, with superclasses being more general and subclasses being more specific. What this means is that in addition to their own specialized variables and methods, <span class="code">Soldier</span>'s child classes (like the ones previously mentioned) would inherit <span class="code">Soldier</span>'s methods as well. 
    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">
       So we've got the <span class="code">Soldier</span> class and its subclasses which together create the whole blueprint for, let's say, a <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span> soldier. Now, let's say you're a <span class="code">WehrmachtSpecOps</span> soldier (a German soldier in Battlefield 1942) and you're holding down a position but you're under fire from three <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span> soldiers. Those three <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span> soldiers are what are known as <span class="code">Object</span>s. They are instances of the <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span> class, because they're built on the blueprint for a US Special Forces soldier. If you don't like video games or war, then think of it in car terms. It's like you have the design (the class) for a Tesla Model S, and then you have each actual physical Tesla that rolls out of their plant here in Silicon Valley (the objects). Class = design/blueprint, objects = the actual things. Make sense?
