      The concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) aims to mimic things (objects) in real world. Just like objects and things exist in the real world, OOP aims to structure a program in a manner in which objects and things exist as a core structural component of a program's source code. One of the best way to describe this is through the video game example. Let's go with the popular Battlefield franchise. For better or worse, war is very much a reality of the modern world. In every war, there are people involved, as well as weapons and vehicles like tanks, ships, and fighter jets, among many other things. To further break it down, let's think about all the types of people involved. There are definitely civilians involved. There are obvioulsy soldiers involved too, right? Let's keep breaking it down. Out of all the soldiers, there are different factions, such as U.S. soldiers and Russian soldiers. And in each faction, there are numerous types of soldiers, like infantry, medics, engineers, support, special forces, Navy SEALs, etc. In Battlefield 1942, each type of soldier gets different things by default. For example, if you're an American medic, your primary weapon is the Thompson submachine gun, your secondary weapon is M1911 .45 caliber handgun, your "gadget" is the Medical Bag, your melee weapon is a knife, you carry grenades, and your starting health is '30'.

      While I've never actually seen the source code for Battlefield 1942, I'm going to assume that it was written in an object-oriented language (probably C++). In the case of the soldier, there would be a master class <span class="code">Person</span>. This class would be what is known as a "superclass", or "parent class", meaning that it has "subclasses" or "child classes" which would include the <span class="code">Soldier</span> and <span class="code">Civilian</span> classes. The <span class="code">Soldier</span> class would itself be the direct superclass of the <span class="code">USArmySoldier</span>, <span class="code">BritishArmySoldier</span>, <span class="code">FrenchArmySoldier</span>, and <span class="code">CanadianArmySoldier</span> classes. The <span class="code">USArmySoldier</span> class would effectively act as the "blueprint" for a generic American soldier in Battlefield 1942. It would contain the variables and methods common to each type of American soldier. Think of it. In a first-person shooter video game, what would each type of <span class="code">USArmySoldier</span> have in common regardless of whether they're <span class="code">USSpecialForces</span>, <span class="code">USMedic</span>, <span class="code">USInfantry</span>, or <span class="code">USEngineer</span>?
