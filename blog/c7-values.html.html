      This week we are tasked with thinking about <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">self-affirmation</a> and how it can help one phase out the effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">stereotype threat</a>. Self-affirmation is the recognition and assertion of the existence and value of one's individual self. It is the process of thinking about the characteristics, skills, values, or roles that one values or views as important (<a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_schimel_arndt_banko_cook.html">Schimel, Arndt, Banko, & Cook, 2004</a>). These are some of the values that come to my mind when practicing self-affirmation: Accomplishment, Ambition, Confidence, Coolness under fire, Economic security, Health, Meaningful work, Money, Personal development, Security, Tranquility, Adventure, Competence, Environmentalism, Growth, Movement, Achievement, Challenge, Responsibility, Wealth, Competition, Excellence, Freedom, Helping society, Independence, Intellectual status, Knowledge, Recognition, and Will-power.

      When asked to pick a number between 1 (being disagree) and 5 (being agree) in response to the statement "In general, I try to live up to these values", I picked 4. While I know that I'm on the right track, there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to general self improvement and living up to my expectations. For example, one of the moments where I felt proud of myself was when I decided to turn my life around from one of bad health and poor habits to one of great health and great habits. I quit smoking and did a number of other things I should have done long before, and I started focusing on fitness and my general bodily and mental health. I began to go to the gym five days a week. However, things have been extremely busy lately, and I haven't had as much time to exercise. While some of that is out of my control, I'm sure I could find ways to fit a 30 min workout somewhere in my workday.

    <p class="bodytext">
       One of the values I hold closest is ambition. Ambition can be defined as the desire and determination to achieve success. The reason for my choice is because ambition is a prerequisite to achieving a great number of the other values I have listed. For example, it is Ambition that leads one to pursue the challenges that, once overcome, produce a strong sense of Accomplishment. A strong sense of Accomplishment helps to build Confidence, which, in-turn, allows one to keep a sense of Coolness under fire. The ability to remain cool under fire promotes inner Tranquility in the face of extreme pressure and stress, which are two things that are often side-effects of Responsibility, Independence, Meaningful work, and the pursuit of Economic security. Ambition is a necessary prerequisite to one's general Will-power and drive, which I believe are two of the most important qualities to have. 
    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">
       Thinking about these values is important to me. It helps to remind me of what it takes to realize my short-term goals as well as my life dreams. It keep things in perspective and helps me stay focused on the big picture. It keeps me on my toes, and most importantly, it keeps me moving forward. If I recognize or feel stereotype threat, I believe that thinking about these values will help my mind phase it out of the picture to the point where I acknowledge its presence and stop falling victim to it. Life is to short to waste thinking about how others percieve you - let 'em think what they want, because I don't have time to care.
    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">
       And if, for whatever reason, I start feeling down while at DBC, I'll just think about the door to the awesome world of opportunities that will soon open once I have the skills to become a full-stack web developer!
